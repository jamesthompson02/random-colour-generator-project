# random-colour-generator-project
A beginner project which involves using basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. Using Javascript in this  project helped to build my knowledge of programming fundamentals. In particular, it strengthened my knowledge of: for loops, while loops, if else statements and functions. Also, it again reinforced my knowledge of how to manipulate the Dom. Moreover, it strengthened my knowledge of event listeners (both 'click' and 'keypress' ). Finally, it introduced me to using the clipboard API in order to be able to copy the inner text of an HTML element by clicking a separate icon.
